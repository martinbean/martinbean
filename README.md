Hi! :wave:

I’m Martin Bean, an experienced software engineer and web developer based in the UK. I currently lead of a team of developers at a product company called [OpenPlay][1]. Prior to this, I worked at [Pfizer][2], first as part of their DevOps team before moving into a tech lead role, where I directed two company-wide transformation and consolidation projects.

Outside of my full time role I run [Your Fight Site][3]. Under its banner I operate two services targeting professional wrestling and combat sport promoters: a website builder called Your Fight Site CMS, and a video on demand marketplace called [Your Fight Site VOD][4].

In my spare time I dabble in reverse engineering video games, specifically PlayStation® 1. This has been a hugely interesting endeavour for me, going from knowing little about computer architecture and hardware to learning concepts like CPUs and registers, as well as assembly and the C programming language, and also just how video games were actually made in that time period.

I’m a lifelong learner with a thirst for knowledge, and enjoy sharing this knowledge. I’m active in communities such as Stack Overflow and the Laracasts forums, and I now share this knowledge in my current role as a team lead.
