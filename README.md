Hi! :wave:

I’m Martin Bean, an experienced web developer and team lead based in the UK. Day to day I work with PHP, Laravel, JavaScript and TypeScript, and AWS.

I have over 15 years’ experience in building web-based solutions and APIs for companies of all sizes, from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies.

Outside of my full time role I run a company called [Your Fight Site][1], where I help independent professional wrestling and combat sport promoters through two products: a multi-tenant CMS, and a video on demand platform called [Your Fight Site VOD][2]

In my spare time I pursue an interest in reverse engineering, particularly PlayStation&reg; 1 video games. This has been a hugely interesting and rewarding endeavour, where I’ve gone from knowing little about a computer’s internals to gaining a high-level understanding of hardware architecture, CPUs and registers, and both MIPS assembly and the C programming language.

I’m a lifelong learner with a thirst for knowledge, and enjoy sharing this knowledge and enthusiam in both my work and my spare time. I’m also active in developer communities such as [Stack Overflow][3] and the [Laracasts forums][4]
