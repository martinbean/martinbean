Hi! :wave:

**I’m Martin.** I’m a software developer with over 10 years’ experience and comfortable working across the entire web stack include front-end, back-end, and with cloud services such as [Amazon Web Services][1] and [Google Cloud Platform][2].

Day-to-day I work with PHP, JavaScript, and related technologies. In my spare time, I’m learning [Go][9], [Swift][10], and BrightScript.

I also enjoy helping over developers. Through helping other developers, I’ve managed to be in the **top 1%** of Stack Overflow users ([profile][8]); and help aspiring <abbr title="Demonym for developers working with Laravel">Artisans</abbr> on the [Laracasts forums][3] and official [Laravel Discord server][4].

I currently work for [Pfizer][5], part of a platform team enabling the wider business to launch digital products quickly and cost-effectively. Outside of my day job, I operate a business called [Your Fight Site][6], where I’ve built and operate a SaaS products for professional wrestling and combat sport promoters. Products include a multi-tenant <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> imaginately called “Your Fight Site CMS” and a video on demand marketplace called [Your Fight Site VOD][7].
