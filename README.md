Hi! :wave:

**I’m Martin Bean.** I’m a developer with over 15 years’ experience that’s comfortable working across the entire web stack: from front-end to back-end to even DevOps. Technologies I use day to day include PHP (particularly Laravel), Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, JavaScript and TypeScript, and Amazon Web Services.

I like to write code that’s easy to read, easy to work with, and solves complex problems in the simplest and most expressive way possible. I therefore like types, and for example will always use TypeScript over JavaScript where possible.

I also like to continually learn and push myself; I’m never satisfied with just resting on my laurels or “knowing enough”. I like to learn new languages and technologies and to try and find out how they can compliment and improve my existing skills, and also find opportunities where this new knowledge may be better suited for problems I may have solved prior as well as going forward. In the past I have learnt and dabbled with Swift, Go, Flutter, and BrightScript. I’m currently learning Rust and the Unreal Engine 5 game engine.

Currently, I work for [Pfizer][1]. I started out in a DevOps role, working on a platform that builds and maintains stacks for technology teams within the business, and also instils best practices in those teams. I later moved to leading a product team tasked with consolidating documentation across platform teams, and then consolidating dashboards of those platform teams to reduce duplicated effort and spend across the company.

In my (little) spare time, I run a company called [Your Fight Site][2]. I used to create websites for independent professional wrestling organisations, but “productized” this service and created a <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> platform for building wrestling, <abbr title="Mixed Martial Arts">MMA</abbr>, and boxing websites. In 2014, I then embarked on creating a video on demand platform from scratch, which at the time I built using AWS for storing, transcoding, and securely delivering video using S3, ElasticTranscoder, and CloudFront respectively. I have since refactored the platform to use Mux instead for video transcoding and delivery. Both of these services use Stripe for billing and Stripe Connect to allow my customers to transact, so are self-sufficient and require little input from me day to day.
